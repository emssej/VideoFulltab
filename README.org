#+TITLE: Video Fulltab

* What it's about
  *Video Fulltab* is an extension that maximizes videos not to the
  whole screen, but to the whole tab area (the viewport). It works on
  all HTML5 videos, and soon it'll work on YouTube as well as some
  other websites given requests (or you can implement it yourself). It
  maximizes the /focused/ video, so make sure you click on one first.
* Shortcuts?
  Given the fact that Chrome supports shortcuts for extensions, you
  can set it in the extensions menu. In =chrome://extensions=, click
  on the hamburger menu and click /Keyboard Shortcuts/. Add a nice
  shortcut, for example the character =`=, and enjoy using this
  extension.
