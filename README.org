#+TITLE: Video Fulltab

* What it's about
  *Video Fulltab* is an extension that maximizes videos not to the
  whole screen, but to the whole tab area (the viewport). It works on
  all HTML5 videos, YouTube, and some other choice websites. It's much
  faster than the already-existing "windowed fullscreen" extensions on
  the Chrome Web Store---it's almost instantenous in changing to
  fulltab and from fulltab state.
* Shortcuts?
  Given the fact that Chrome supports shortcuts for extensions, you
  can set it in the extensions menu. In =chrome://extensions=, click
  on the hamburger menu and click /Keyboard Shortcuts/. Add a nice
  shortcut, for example =Ctrl+Shift+E= (or keep the default
  =Ctrl+Shift+F=), and enjoy using this extension.
* Things to do
  - For the YouTube handler, scale the controls as well,
  - Perhaps make the ESC key work as a disabler of fulltab.
