#+TITLE: Video Fulltab

* What it's about
  *Video Fulltab* is an extension that maximizes videos not to the
  whole screen, but to the whole tab area (the viewport). It works on
  all HTML5 videos, YouTube, and some other choice websites.
* Shortcuts?
  Given the fact that Chrome supports shortcuts for extensions, you
  can set it in the extensions menu. In =chrome://extensions=, click
  on the hamburger menu and click /Keyboard Shortcuts/. Add a nice
  shortcut, for example =Ctrl+Shift+E= (or keep the default
  =Ctrl+Shift+F=), and enjoy using this extension.
* Things to do
  - Add a better system for handling "manual" websites (like YouTube,
    TVP VOD, etc.),
  - Use regex for URL detection,
  - For the YouTube handler, scale the controls as well,
  - Perhaps make the ESC key work as a disabler of Fulltab.
